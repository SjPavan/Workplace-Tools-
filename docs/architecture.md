# Architecture Overview

This repository is organized as a multi-surface product with clearly separated concerns for execution, delivery, and documentation. Each top-level workspace maps to a major component of the platform:

- **backend/** – application APIs and business logic
- **worker/** – asynchronous and scheduled job processors
- **web/** – browser-based user experiences
- **mobile/** – native or cross-platform mobile applications
- **infra/** – infrastructure-as-code, deployment pipelines, and environment automation
- **docs/** – canonical documentation shared across teams
- **legacy/** – archived utilities and prior implementations retained for reference

At this stage the codebase hosts scaffolding to support future implementation. As services are added, prefer cross-cutting tooling (linters, formatters, test runners) driven from the shared `scripts/` directory so that all surfaces stay consistent.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** – Keep component-specific logic within its workspace to simplify ownership and deployment.
2. **Shared Standards** – Reuse linting, testing, and CI tooling across services to deliver consistent quality.
3. **Documentation First** – Document architectural decisions and service responsibilities alongside the code to provide clear onboarding paths.

For additional design updates, extend this architecture document so downstream README files can continue to point to a single source of truth.
