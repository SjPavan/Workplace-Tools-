# Documentation Workspace

This directory centralizes planning artifacts and shared documentation for the project. Start with the [architecture overview](./architecture.md) for a high-level understanding of how the platform is organized. Additional design notes, ADRs, and onboarding guides should be added here as the system evolves.
