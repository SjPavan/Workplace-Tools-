# Workplace Tools

Static collection of single-file tools used day-to-day. Open any HTML file in this directory directly in your browser to use it offline.

## Available utilities
- **Title Case Converter** – `title_case_converter_single_file_html.html` and variant with clipboard helpers.
- **Virtual Browser Demo** – `Qwen_html_20250924_xxuex19de.html` and related mock assistant sandboxes.
- **Web Extraction Console** – `web_extraction_console.html` offers a job builder wizard, schedule management, realtime telemetry (mocked with Supabase-style events), result previews, export downloads, filters, retry controls, and logging.

Each tool is self-contained with inline styling and scripts; no build or runtime dependencies are required.
